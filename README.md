**About Me**

I am a third-year Computer Science and Math student at the University of Maryland expecting to graduate in Spring 2025. Originally, I was a Physics major and wanted to pursue a career in academia and learn more about the mechanics underlying our universe. However, I decided to pursue my passion for games instead. As a result of my STEM-heavy upbringing, I enjoy learning more about game engine design as well as techniques that push the limits of what is technically possible in gaming. On the other hand, the main appeal to game development for me personally is the ability to create a digital world without restrictions. Recently I have set the goal for myself to learn game development and more specifically Unity by creating a game for myself. Although I hope the game, *Endless RPG*, will be a success eventually, for now, it is nothing more than a hobby and a means of practicing new skills.

TODO: format this with links, for now A brief summary: I will be placing some class projects here that showcase a basic competency with a handful of languages, practices, data structures, and algorithms.
