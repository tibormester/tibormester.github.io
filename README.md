**About Me**

I am a third-year Computer Science and Math student at the University of Maryland expecting to graduate in Spring 2025. Originally, I was a Physics major and wanted to pursue a career in academia and learn more about the mechanics underlying our universe. However, I decided to pursue my passion for games instead. As a result of my STEM-heavy upbringing, I enjoy learning more about game engine design as well as techniques that push the limits of what is technically possible in gaming. On the other hand, the main appeal to game development for me personally is the ability to create a digital world without restrictions. Recently I have set the goal for myself to learn game development and more specifically Unity by creating a game for myself. Although I hope the game, *[Endless RPG](https://github.com/tibormester/EndlessRPG)*, will be a success eventually, for now, it is nothing more than a hobby and a means of practicing new skills. 

**Table Of Contents**

TODO: format this with links, for now A brief summary: I will be placing some class projects here that showcase a basic competency with a handful of languages, practices, data structures, and algorithms.
**Data Structures**
*[AVL Tree](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/avl.py) An AVL tree is a BST that self balances through rotations
*[Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/bst.py) An implementation of a standard BST that tallies key counts that can be incremented and decremented through insertion and deletion
*[B Tree](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/btree.py) Similar to a BST, but has several keys and values per node enabling denser data storage as well as easy access to neighboring values
*[KD Tree](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/kd.py) A multi-dimensional approach to a BST that is often used in game engines for storing physics objects
*[Skip List](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/skiplist.py) A variation of a linked list that at the cost of space enables O(log n) search complexity. Basically a BST and Linked List together.
*[Splay Tree](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/splay.py) A BST that stays balanced by requiring splay operations. This is done through mathematical magic.
**Algorithms**
*[Mixed Nash Equilibrium Solver](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/Mixed.java) Mixed Nash Equilibrium is a concept in game theory that represents a state where no agent can unilaterally change their choice of action for a better outcome
*[Expected Value](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/expectation.py) Just a simple script to compute the expected value for a Game Theory Homework problem
*[Reversi Competition](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/reversi.py) A group project where we compete against other groups in a game of reversi. Our algorithm picks the best move by calculating not only the payoff of its turn but the best move for the opponent given our move
**Other**
*[Blackjack](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/blob/master/Blackjack.java) A simple Java project to play blackjack against the Computer Dealer
*[Projective Geometry Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/tibormester/tibormester.github.io/files/14003304/Projective.Geometry.Presentation.pptx) Slides for a minor presentation I gave on Applications of Projective Geometry for Computer Graphics, which I gave during my course in Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
